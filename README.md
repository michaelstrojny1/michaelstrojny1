## Michael Strojny

Hey 👋

I'm a 2nd year University of Toronto Electrical + Computer Engineering Student interested in analog integrated circuits and chip design. I'm interested in developing more energy efficient computing hardware for AI and robotics. I'm also interested in Probabilistic Computing, which I've been researching since 2024, collaborating on projects with University of Toronto Professor Zeb Tate and the University of Toronto Machine Inteligence Student Team.
