## Michael Strojny

I'm a 2nd year University of Toronto Electrical + Computer Engineering Student interested in analog circuits, digital design and power electronics. I'm interested in developing more energy efficient computing for AI and robotics. My main ML field of interest is Probabilistic Machine Learning, which I've been researching since 2024.
