Hey 👋

I'm a 2nd year University of Toronto Electrical + Computer Engineering Student interested in analog circuits, digital design and power electronics. I'm interested in developing more energy efficient computing for AI and robotics. I'm also interested in Probabilistic ML and Computing, which I've been researching since 2024, collaborating with University of Toronto Professor Zeb Tate and the University of Toronto Machine Inteligence Student Team.
